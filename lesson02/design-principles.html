                    Visual hierarchy in design refers to the arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies importance.
                It influences the order in which the human eye perceives what it sees.
                    This concept is used in various fields of design,including graphic design, web design, and interior design, 
                to organize and prioritize content effectively so that viewers can naturally gravitate towards the most important elements first.

                The Rule of Thirds is a fundamental guideline in visual composition, applied across various art forms including photography, 
                graphic design, painting, and filmmaking. It involves dividing an image into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines,
                creating a grid with nine equally-sized rectangles. The points where these lines intersect are called focal points or points of interest.

            <p>
                White space, also known as negative space, is a crucial element in design. 
                It refers to the areas of a layout that are left empty or unmarked, not just white areas.
                This space can be any color, texture, or even a background image. White space is not merely 'blank' space —
                it is an important element of design which enables the objects in it to exist. It should be regarded as an active element, not a passive background.
